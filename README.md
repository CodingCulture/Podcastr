A CMS for Podcasters built with CakePHP

## What?

This is a content management systme built for podcasters to distribute their content. It's key features are automatic iTunes feed generation,
an intuitive and easy to use management console, and a built-in webplayer for users to enjoy your content online that supports a table of content
which can be used to skip parts of the podcast

## Status

Podcastr is not yet ready for prime time. I am building this for a podcast for a friend of mine. When his needs are completed,
I will start and abstract away things like themes.

Furthermore, I'd like to implement some API's like the SoundCloud API, Facebook API and Twitter API. For more on the status
of this project, please view the issue tracker.

- Version 1.0 (Ed): [In progress](https://github.com/nielsvermaut/podcastr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Aed+)
- Version 2.0 (Edd): [Pre production](https://github.com/nielsvermaut/podcastr/issues?q=is%3Aissue-milestone%3Aedd+)

## Installation

Installing podcastr is fairly easy. Just review our [install.md](https://github.com/nielsvermaut/podcastr/blob/master/install/install.md/)-file.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

Podcastr was built using: CakePHP, Bootstrap, Moment.js, Soundmaster2.js, Disqus and Bootstrap-multiselect. We'd like to thank all the maintainers for their work, making ours tremendously easier.

# Podcastr
Manage your Podcasts with ease

## Work In Progress

Hi, We're busy on making sure this program is as squeky clean as possbile before we release it completely. So don't install it yet,
but be sure to keep an eye on this repo.

## What is Podcastr

Podcastr is a selfhosted solution for managing and broadcasting your podcasts over iTunes or other RSS based podcast-trackers, next to having a powerful engine to create a fully realised website where your listeners can enjoy your podcasts in a rich experience.

## Why create Podcastr

We at CodingCulture are firm believers in Open Source, and we believe that the web has become a better place by having Open Source projects, that in turn monitize through delivering services like hosting and such, much like the Wordpress.org/.com model. We were sad to see that such a model doesn't really exist in the podcast world.

Yes, you have services like libsyn, but the flexibility is pretty low for our taste and the fact that you couldn't install it yourself as mentioned before motivated us to work on a custom solution for a project we were working on (http://gamehour.be]).

We have been working on this tool for a few months now, and we've hit a lot of technical bumps (and always found a way around them, mind you), so we are pretty sure we've nailed the basic concepts and needs. 

## Isn't it ready yet?

Not yet. We are working on getting the code agnostic to what we've done in our personal project, and we'd like to add some touches to make the system really friendly to beginners (read getting an installer ready) and developers (read having an frontend API so that developers can theme their website). So stick with us, and we hope that you'll endure the long waiting period.

What's in the pipeline right now:
- Installer.
- Frontend API (Theming system).
- A blogging system or reporting system to an external source (We'd like the first option, to keep the Frontend codebase as low as possible for devs).
- Hardening of the user management (Right now, if you lose your password, you'll be locked out).
- A better Admin UI.
 

What would be really cool:
- A plugin system (We are getting a spec ready)
- A Hosted platform (Only if we see there is a demand for it)

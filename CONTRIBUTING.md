## Bugs

If you've encountered a bug, and you know it's not originating from CakePHP (if you are not certain, we are probably the problem), you should put it in our Issue tracker. This has a template, to make it easier for us to find the bug's cause.

```

Occurence place: [The URL where the issue can be found]
Variables:  [What was your input, what did you click to trigger the error]
- - -
[A description and if neccesary a screenshot]

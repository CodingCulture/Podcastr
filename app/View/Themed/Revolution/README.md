Podcastr Skeleton Theme
=======================

This is an empty theme with the correct folder structure, so that CakePHP will recognize it. It is completely empty
with only a bootstrap fallback on a font, just in case.

Podcastr comes by default loaded with Bootstrap (css and js) and jQuery, so it is not neccesary to reload them, unless
you choose to have a different layout file.

However, it is not neccesary to copy these files to your themes webroot. They are still available from the root webroot, 
you'll just need to call them by respectively $this->Html->css() and $this->Html->script();
